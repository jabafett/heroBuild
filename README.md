# [heroBuild](https://jabafetts-dns.xyz/)

<p>Just a learning project for me to learn react/next as well as typescript, 
Frameworks of a hero item builder that would allow you quickly compare the 
pros and cons of different items quicker than you can in game.
Needs the backends somewhat finished and formatted aswell as a way to more 
easily update the item value changes after updates. Not really something
I want to dedicate that much time to but I am happy with what I learned from this.</p>
